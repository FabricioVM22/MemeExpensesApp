## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intuitive Dashboard:** Get an at-a-glance overview of your current balance, monthly income, and total expenses. Includes a quick view of recent transactions.
- **Effortless Transaction Tracking:** Quickly add income or expense transactions with descriptions, dates, and categories through a clean, user-friendly modal.
- **Dynamic Monthly Budgeting:** Set spending limits for each category to stay on top of your finances. The UI provides real-time feedback on your total budgeted amount versus your monthly income.
- **Dedicated Event Budgets:** Create separate budgets for special events like vacations, birthdays, or projects. This keeps one-off expenses isolated from your regular monthly finances for clearer tracking.
- **Insightful Spending Analytics:** Visualize your spending per category against your set budget with clear, color-coded progress bars. Instantly see where you're over budget.
- **Comprehensive Transaction History:** Review your financial activity for all previous months in an organized, collapsible accordion view. Sort transactions by date for easy analysis.
- **Fully Customizable Categories:** Add, edit, or delete spending categories. Personalize each with a unique name, color, and a wide selection of icons to make the app truly yours.
- **Secure Data Backup & Restore:** Easily export all your application data (transactions, budgets, events) to a single JSON file for backup. Import it on any device to restore your state, ensuring you never lose your data.
- **100% Local Data Storage:** All your financial data is stored securely in your browser's `localStorage`. There are no cloud accounts, no data sharing, and no internet connection required for core functionality.
- **Beautiful Theming:** Choose from a clean **Light** theme, a sleek **Dark** theme, or a romantic **Rose** theme to match your style.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first design that works beautifully on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops, with dedicated navigation for each.
- **Multi-Language Support:** The app supports multiple languages (English and Spanish) and automatically detects the user's browser preference on first load.

## üöÄ Tech Stack & Philosophy

This project is built with modern, minimalist web technologies, prioritizing performance, developer experience, and maintainability without a complex build setup.

- **[React 19](https://react.dev/):** The core of our UI, using the latest features for building a fast, component-based interface.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Ensures code quality, maintainability, and a robust development experience with static typing.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid, custom UI development directly in the markup without writing custom CSS. It's configured to work with our dynamic theming engine.
- **Custom SVG Icons:** All icons are implemented as React components for consistency, performance, and easy styling.
- **Zero-Build with ES Modules:** The app uses native ES Modules directly in the browser via an `importmap` in `index.html`. This eliminates the need for a complex build pipeline (like Webpack or Vite) for development, simplifying the setup and speeding up load times.

## üß† Core Concepts Explained

### State Management & Data Persistence

The application's state is managed within the main `App.tsx` component using React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`), acting as a single source of truth.

To ensure data persistence and offline functionality, a custom hook `useLocalStorage` is employed. This hook syncs state variables (like transactions, categories, and budgets) with the browser's `localStorage`. It automatically saves any changes and rehydrates the state on page load. It also includes robust error handling for cases where storage is unavailable or corrupted, alerting the user gracefully.

### Theming Engine

The app supports multiple themes (light, dark, rose), defined as simple objects in `theme.ts`. The `generateThemeCss` utility converts these theme objects into CSS custom properties (variables) at runtime. These variables are then injected into a `<style>` tag in the document head.

Tailwind CSS is configured in `index.html` to use these CSS variables for semantic coloring (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-primary`). This allows the entire UI to adapt instantly when the theme is toggled without a page reload.

### Responsive Navigation

The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) where view navigation is handled by a state variable (`activeView`) in `App.tsx`. The navigation UI is responsive:
- **Mobile:** A `BottomNav` component is rendered, providing familiar, thumb-friendly navigation.
- **Desktop/Tablet:** On screens wider than the `md` breakpoint (768px), the bottom nav is hidden, and a persistent `SideNav` component is displayed for a traditional desktop experience.

### Privacy-First Data Handling

User privacy is paramount. All data is stored exclusively on the user's device in `localStorage`. There is no backend server, no user accounts, and no network requests for data.

The **Import/Export** feature empowers users to manage their own data. The export function uses the `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL` APIs to create a downloadable JSON file. The import function uses the `FileReader` API to read a user-selected file and safely parse it before overwriting the application state, giving the user full control.

### Internationalization (i18n)

Localization is managed via `LocalizationContext`. It detects the user's browser language on first visit to set the default language. The `useLocalization` hook provides a `t` function to all components, which retrieves translated strings from the appropriate file in the `locales/` directory. This function also supports dynamic placeholder replacements for values like currency amounts.

### Accessibility (a11y)

We strive to make Meme Budget accessible to everyone. Key accessibility practices include:
- **Semantic HTML:** Using appropriate HTML5 tags (`<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
- **ARIA Roles:** Applying ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `role="progressbar"`) to enhance screen reader compatibility for custom components like dropdowns and progress bars.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are focusable and usable with a keyboard.
- **Color Contrast:** Themes are designed with color contrast in mind to ensure readability.
